                  It is always a pleasure training with Engage Fitness! 
                  He was my trainer for over 3 years and went above and
                  beyond for my fitness needs! My work schedule is ever-changing,
                  so this platform suits me perfectly. I would always recommend 
                  engage fitness for reaching
                  your fitness goals. I was able to get back on track and exceed
                  mine. I also referred them to various friends and work colleagues
                  for training. They all had a positive experience and gave great
                  feedback

                  It is always a pleasure training with Ben from Anywhere
                  Fitness! He was my trainer for over 3 years and went above and
                  beyond for my fitness needs! My work schedule is ever-changing,
                  so having a personal trainer come to my house in the evenings
                  worked out nicely. I would always recommend Ben for reaching
                  your fitness goals. I was able to get back on track and exceed

                  clients and customize the fitness plan for each individual.

                  Ben was referred to myself by one of my friends about 5 years
                  ago. From the beginning, I trained with him 3x week. Ive had a
                  long term relationship with him as my trainer. I was working
                  long hours and needed to work out on a regular basis with
                  somebody who could accommodate my schedule. Personal training at
                  home with Ben was the perfect solution for me. He is very
                  professional - always on time, experienced and flexible about
                  booking/cancelling sessions to work around my busy work
                  schedule, especially on weekends. He encouraged me to do more
                  between sessions by sending me workout programs that are simple
                  to follow. I referred Ben to several of my colleagues as well.
                  If you are looking to start fitness sessions at home, get in
                  touch with Ben, he'll keep you on track!
